# Mathematica Notebooks for Physics

Notebooks I've used throughout Bachelor's degree in Physics at the [Autonomous University of Barcelona](http://www.uab.cat/web/universitat-autonoma-de-barcelona-1345467954774.html).

Most of the notebooks are for assignments, but there are also some examples, exam problems, or visual demonstrations (which arguably could've been CDF documents).

## Required packages
Some notebooks require the [Quantum](http://homepage.cem.itesm.mx/jose.luis.gomez/quantum/) package by [José Luis Gómez-Muñoz](http://www.wolfram.com/training/instructors/gomez.html).
